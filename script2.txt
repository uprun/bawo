Hello 
 Hello 
I like to code in JS
 Javascript
  wait wait wait
I do know about OOP inheritance incapsulation and SOLID and other stuff
 I do program in one of the mainstream compilable programming languages for my daily job
  I do know what kind of bugs can prevent type checker
   I also know how code becomes rigid to change

so I do prefer dynamic interpretation and REPL-style programming like in Lisp or Python or Smalltalk
  [Read Eval Print Loop]

I like to run my code for different scenarios 
 and 
I am impatient
  ... and compile time just gets in a way
   so it is better when it is absent

   web-browser is my REPL now

so in this video
 I decided I will announce the simplest bare-minimum web-browser development project
  in Javascript
   with Raylib
    name is Bawo 
      short for Bawowna // my previous attempt in Golang
 
 so stay tuned

    [Demo]

    Post Scriptum 
     this time I have a script but I am short on time so no fancy video
