I like to create my own tools
 I started over 20 years ago while still at school 
and this was the best time for me
  because there was no Internet
I mean I love Internet
 it gives you a lot of information ... and rabbit hole of youtube and wikipedia
right I can spend way more time than I would actually need on youtube 
 nah that does not sound like a joke in the middle of a talk
I also very bad at writing
 would I be better at writing if I just used the conventional keyboard 
  ahm - yeah
but I decided to use this split keyboard for whater reason
